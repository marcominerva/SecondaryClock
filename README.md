# Secondary Clock
A clock that is shown on secondary (last) Taskbar on Windows 11.

At this moment, there isn't any configuration available: just copy the application on your system and add a shortcut to the **SecondaryClock.exe** file int the Startup Folder of Windows 11, by pressing WIN+R and go to _shell:startup_.
